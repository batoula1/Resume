                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>I am dedicated to pursuing six months of intensive, in-person software development
                    training. I learned to code through a combination of self-study, online resources, and
                    formal education. Initially, I began exploring programming languages like Python and
                    Java through online tutorials and coding challenges on platforms such as Codecademy,
                    Coursera, and freeCodeCamp.
                    These resources provided a solid foundation in programming concepts, syntax, and
                    problem-solving skills.
                    Overall, my overarching goal as a developer is to contribute my skills and expertise to
                    meaningful projects, foster a collaborative and inclusive work culture, and continuously
                    grow and evolve in my career journey.
